# Bytloos
### (aka Bydlo Tools) â€“ essential bydlocoding kit.

"Bydlo" in some Slavic languages means large crowd of working class people.

The bydlocoding literally stands for codecrafting for small business needs. It's generally cheap, fast and based on reinvented wheels.

So there are some tools for more flexible bydlocoding development:
* HTTP client;
* FTP client;
* CSV serializer;
* and some useful extension methods and utilities.

Examples: coming soon.
